# Flappy Bird AI Project

Flappy Bird AI Demo

This repository contains a project where we trained a machine learning algorithm to play the popular game Flappy Bird. We've created a Flappy Bird clone and implemented an AI agent that learns and improves its performance over time through machine learning techniques.

# Project Overview
Flappy Bird is a classic side-scrolling mobile game that requires the player to navigate a bird through a series of pipes that have gaps in between. The challenge lies in tapping the screen at the right time to make the bird flap its wings and stay afloat, avoiding collisions with the pipes.

In this project, we took the following steps:

Flappy Bird Clone: We developed a clone of the Flappy Bird game environment that mimics the original gameplay mechanics. The game provides an interface for the AI agent to interact with, allowing it to control the bird's actions.

Machine Learning Algorithm: We implemented a machine learning algorithm, specifically a reinforcement learning approach, to train the AI agent. The agent learns by playing the game repeatedly and receiving rewards or penalties based on its performance.

Training Process: The AI agent goes through multiple training iterations. During each iteration, it plays the game many times while adjusting its actions based on the rewards it receives. Over time, the agent learns to make better decisions to achieve higher scores.

Performance Improvement: As the training progresses, the AI's performance should improve. It will gradually learn optimal strategies for navigating the bird through the pipes and avoiding collisions.

# Getting Started
To run the Flappy Bird AI project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.

Dependencies: Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. This might include libraries for game development and machine learning. You can find the required dependencies in the requirements.txt file.

Run the Code: Execute the main script that sets up the game environment and the machine learning algorithm. This script will initiate the training process, and you'll be able to observe the AI agent's progress in the game.

# Demo
You can watch a demo of our trained AI agent playing Flappy Bird in action. The demo showcases how the AI learned to navigate the bird through the pipes and achieve high scores.
